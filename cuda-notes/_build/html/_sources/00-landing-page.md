## Why I wrote this

I stumbled upon the llm.c repo by Andrej Karpathy(Thanks for all the educational content, I owe you a lot). The pytorch does a lot of abstraction and I really didn't know what was going on inside, but I was always curious I didn't take any action to learn it. After checking the llm.c repo, I decided to do learn about GPU programming, since I have always used NVIDIA GPUs, cuda was a defualt choice for me to know what is really going on behind all the pytorch codes I had written.

So this is an attempt to document my learning about Cuda C++ in my free time and possibly others will benefit from this as well.

## Acknowledgments
The following resources have helped me majorly,
1) [Main website](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/cuda-training-series/), [Cuda-Training-Series - YT playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6RdenZrxrw-zNX7uuGppWETdxt_JxdMj).
2) [llm.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/).
4) [NVIDIA Blogs](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/developer-blog-cuda-refresher-july-2020-updated/)
3) The Internet.

As I write each article I will provide the resources which helped me to understand the concepts better.

## Pre-requisite
The readers should have basic C or C++ knowledge.
